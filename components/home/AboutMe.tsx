          ABOUT ME
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg">
          ðŸŽ“ I am a Control and Automation Engineer who found software
          development to be an opportunity to work with modern and continuously
          evolving technologies. With 5 years of experience in Industrial
          Automation â€” especially in the Siemens ecosystem â€” I bring a solid
          background in PLC logic, industrial networks, and programming.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 text-lg">
          ðŸ’» Currently, Iâ€™m working as a full-stack developer, focusing on
          ASP.NET MVC applications. I have experience building robust solutions
          focused on user experience, working on projects that require systems
          integration, data visualization, and customization.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 text-lg">
          ðŸš€ I am particularly interested in Back-End, but I also explore
          Front-End using React, Next.js, and TypeScript. Constantly suffering
          (laughing) with algorithms and applying good practices, Iâ€™m naturally
          curious about software architecture and scalable applications.
